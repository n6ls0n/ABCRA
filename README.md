Drawing inspiration from create-t3-app, like the name implies, this project aims to be a better version of CRA.
It comes with good defaults for beginners and the ability to customize what you want added for seasoned devs. 

To use:
chmod +x abcra.sh
./abcra.sh

Currently allows you to specify the name of the project. The project is then created in the same directory as the repo was cloned into


TODO:
- Automatically update script tags in package.json for webpack
- Allow user to specify the location for the package to be created. Defautl behaviour should be to create it a level above.
